# Time Series Analysis - Household Power Consumption

## Summary
Given the rise of smart electricity meters and the wide adoption of electricity generation technology like solar panels, there is a wealth of electricity usage data available.

This data represents a multivariate time series of power-related variables, that in turn could be used to model and even forecast future electricity consumption.
##

## 1. DATA
The Household Power Consumption dataset is a multivariate time series dataset that describes the electricity consumption for a single household over four years.

The data was collected between December 2006 and November 2010 and observations of power consumption within the household were collected every minute.
